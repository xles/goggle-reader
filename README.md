# Introducing Goggle Reader
an open source Google Reader replacement built on twitter bootstrap.

Google decided to shut down Google Reader, their only useful product
(aside from the obvious, their search engine).  As a direct result, I have
decided that I must recreate the feel of the google reader UI with 
[Twitter Bootstrap](http://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) and jQuery...

## What about the backend?

How the hell should I know?  I haven't figured that part out yet.
PHP and MySQL probably.
